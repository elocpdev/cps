      <p>The Skyblock we know now consists of many different islands scattered around the map, but this was not the case in the early times of Skyblock. The islands were once connected, until they separated in the Calamity. We also know there are two other dimensions, the Dragon Realm and the Rift.
          <br><br>
          Before the current inhabitants, the Skyblock world had an ancient civilisation called the Precursors. They played a huge role in the future development of the world, building huge structures and advanced technologies. However, the species disappeared one day and left behind ruins of their cities and old but powerful relics.
          <br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
          As time went on, other civilisations emerged, forming the different parts of the map. The three main civilisations are the Dwarves, Humans, and the Taika Clan.
          <br><br>
          The Dwarves built a huge kingdom deep in the mines, as they are miners and blacksmiths. Today, they reside in the lowest tier of the Deep Caverns, in a place which we now know as the Dwarven Mines.
          <br><br>
          The Humans live in a more southern area, in a kingdom which we now call the Hub Island. Here, a prestigious mage academy was founded, and it stood, mentoring young mages for 800 years until it fell.
          <br><br>
          The Taika Clan have purplish skin and live on a hellish island called the Crimson Isle. This was not always the case. It is likely that they used to be humans, but did not live in the southern area where the Academy resided. They were normal farmers who also herded pigs, and got separated from the rest of the humans after the Calamity, when their land got split apart.
