    <h1>The Calamity</h1>

    <div class="info">
      <p>As the world continued to develop, all went well, with a mage academy formed in the centre part of Skyblock. This was until one day, the dragon species attacked.
          <br><br>
          The king of the dragons, Jythar, led four generals and his dragon army, wreaking havoc upon the human realm. The mages of the Academy rushed to the castle where the dragons were stationed, using whatever they could to fight back. They had set a trap for Jythar, and he fell right for it.
          <br><br>
          Just when the people thought they’d won, Jythar released a huge blast, killing and destroying everything around him, including his own dragon army. This also caused the land to scatter into many islands. Jythar’s body broke apart, with his heart landing in the current End Island and his body in the Crimson Isles.
          <br><br>
          Academy mages later investigated and found that Jythar had already been dead before the attack, and he had been using Fel magic, a type of dark magic, to “revive” himself. Fearing the dangers this could bring, the mages brought Jythar’s heart to a far island.
          <br><br>
          The once blooming island slowly corrupted into a barren land with spikes shooting out of the ground, infested with mobs called Fel. As the island corrupted, less and less people adventured there.
