      <p>
        Kaeman was a top student of the Academy, who became a renowned researcher. One day, Kaeman was tasked with healing a farmer who ran into an accident. Her name was Sarah. As Kaeman was always invested in his research, he didn’t put much thought into starting a family, but Kaeman and Sarah eventually fell in love and got married.
As time passed, the two had a daughter, Mylah, and Kaeman became a family man and left less time for research. They were a happy family, and Kaeman loved them deeply. However, this would soon end as the Calamity would bring doom to the world.
        <br><br>
As mages of the Academy prepared for war, Kaeman also made his way to the castle. Jythar was a strong opponent, but eventually, the mages had the upper hand, and the Dragon Emperor fell. The fight continued with the remaining survivors on each side, but Kaeman left the fight and ran back home. He knew the blast Jythar released would have destroyed everything in sight, and he needed to know if his family was safe.
        <br><br>
The roof was caved in, and his wife and daughter were nowhere to be found. Kaeman rushed inside and found the two lying dead on the ground. Overwhelmed with grief, Kaeman could not return to the fight. Instead, he had an idea.
        <br><br>
Earlier, Jythar had somehow revived himself using the darkest forms of magic. Fel magic was not studied at all because of its dangers and risks, but Kaeman was determined. He needed his family back.
        <br><br>
For seven years, Kaeman secretly studied Fel magic. Eventually, he was able to revive the bodies of his family, but they were different. They couldn’t remember anything and would wander around day and night like puppets. Kaeman, still determined to find a way, continued studying and researching for three more years. One day, he even found Mylah holding her mother’s hand, giving him hope.
        <br><br>
Kaeman worked endlessly and constantly went out to study. One day, when he was out venturing, a group of patrolling soldiers stumbled upon his lab. Kaeman came home to find all his research taken, his lab in shambles, and worst of all, his wife and daughter lay on the ground, mutated beyond recognition.
        <br><br>
Kaeman was devastated. His family was beyond repair and there was nothing he could do. He cursed the soldiers who had destroyed his only hope, and now, with nothing left, he took the bodies of his beloved to the centre of the island. He cast a powerful spell, one that might even end his life, all to avenge his family. As he stood there, he saw the heads of Mylah and Sarah fuse to each of his shoulders. He had transformed into a powerful being by sacrificing himself.
        <br><br>
Filled with rage, he headed for the castle and unleash a terror similar to the Calamity that destroyed his life. Now, he was no longer Kaeman. He was the Wither King.
